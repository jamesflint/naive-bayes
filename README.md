Springboard Data Science Career Track - Naive Bayes classifier exercises

My submission for the practical project in the Data Science course module: Predicting Movie Ratings from Reviews Using Naive Bayes

Please note the notebook to use here is Mini_Project_Naive_Bayes.ipynb, NOT the one with clean_text in the title, 
which was an early experiment into the effects on the naive bayes classifier of different kinds of text cleaning and 
lemmatization.

The workbook includes four additional exercises:

- Naive bayes using ngrams
- A random forest classifier
- Naive bayes with Latent Dirichlet Allocation
- Naive bayes with Tf-Idf
